All the figures presented in the write-up (including those for cell clustering and dot plots of gene expression patterns) were generated by the code, and their outputs are shown in the code cells.
- octo_brain_homolog_list_top60.csv:  This CSV file lists the top 60 most highly expressed genes for each of the 20 clusters produced by Leiden clustering, along with their corresponding human homolog names.
- octo_brain_annotated.h5ab: (Not included due to size limitations) This file contains the final data after adding cell type annotations based on the top 60 highly expressed genes per cluster.
