- octo_brain_merged.h5ab : Merged data from three octopus brain single-cell RNA samples (octo.brain5, octo.brain6, and octo.brain7).
- octo_brain_decontxed.h5ad: Data file generated after performing DecontX analysis in R 
- octo_brain_preprocessed.h5ab: Data file produced after completing all preprocessing steps.
- final_ob_hu: octopous - File containing the mapping between octopus genes and their human homologs.
